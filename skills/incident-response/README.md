# Incident Response

**Structured incident response workflows and playbooks**

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance on handling production incidents using structured response frameworks, communication protocols, and automation workflows. Integrates with OpenDeRisk agents and n8n for automated incident management.

## When This Skill Activates

- "How do I respond to this incident?"
- "Create an incident response plan"
- "What's the incident severity?"
- "Set up incident communication"
- "Build incident response workflow"
- "Handle a production outage"

## Key Features

- **Incident Classification**: Severity levels and prioritization
- **Response Playbooks**: Step-by-step procedures for common incidents
- **Communication Protocols**: Stakeholder notification and updates
- **Escalation Procedures**: When and how to escalate
- **Post-Mortem Process**: Learning from incidents
- **n8n Automation**: Automated incident response workflows
- **OpenDeRisk Integration**: AI-powered incident analysis

## Incident Severity Levels

- **P0/SEV1**: Critical - Complete service outage
- **P1/SEV2**: High - Major functionality impaired
- **P2/SEV3**: Medium - Minor functionality affected
- **P3/SEV4**: Low - Cosmetic or minimal impact

## Response Framework

### 1. Detection
- Alert triggered or user reported
- Initial assessment

### 2. Response
- Assemble response team
- Begin investigation
- Communicate status

### 3. Mitigation
- Implement temporary fixes
- Restore service

### 4. Resolution
- Deploy permanent fix
- Verify resolution
- Close incident

### 5. Post-Mortem
- Conduct RCA
- Document learnings
- Implement preventive measures
