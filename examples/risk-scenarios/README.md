# Risk Scenarios

This directory contains example risk scenarios with detailed analysis and mitigation strategies.

## Scenarios

### 1. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**File**: `database-connection-exhaustion.md`
**Category**: Performance / Availability
**Severity**: High

A production service experiences database connection pool exhaustion due to a code change that doesn't properly release connections.

**Key Learning Points**:
- Resource leak detection
- Connection pool monitoring
- Code review practices
- Testing strategies

---

### 2. Unencrypted Backup Exposure
**File**: `unencrypted-backup-exposure.md`
**Category**: Security / Compliance
**Severity**: Critical

Database backups are discovered to be stored unencrypted in cloud storage, violating compliance requirements.

**Key Learning Points**:
- Data at rest encryption
- Compliance requirements
- Backup security
- Audit processes

---

### 3. Third-Party API Dependency Failure
**File**: `third-party-api-failure.md`
**Category**: Resilience / Dependencies
**Severity**: High

A critical third-party payment API experiences an outage, cascading to internal systems.

**Key Learning Points**:
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation
- Dependency management
- Fallback strategies

---

### 4. Configuration Drift Leading to Outage
**File**: `configuration-drift-outage.md`
**Category**: Operations / Configuration
**Severity**: Medium

Manual configuration changes across environments lead to inconsistencies and service failures.

**Key Learning Points**:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Configuration management
- Environment parity
- Change control

---

### 5. Insufficient Rate Limiting Causes DDoS
**File**: `ddos-rate-limiting.md`
**Category**: Security / Availability
**Severity**: High

Lack of proper rate limiting allows a DDoS attack to overwhelm the API gateway.

**Key Learning Points**:
- Rate limiting strategies
- DDoS protection
- API security
- Scalability planning
